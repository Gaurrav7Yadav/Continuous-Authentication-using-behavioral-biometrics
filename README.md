## Overview

The Continuous Behavioral Authentication System is designed to authenticate users in real time based on their unique typing patterns. This system enhances security and usability for remote work environments and office applications by providing non-intrusive, continuous identity verification.

---

## Features

- **Real-Time Authentication**: Validates user identity continuously without interrupting their session.
- **Behavioral Biometrics**: Captures and analyzes keystroke patterns as a secure biometric.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Detects deviations in typing behavior, signaling potential unauthorized access.
- **Privacy-Focused**: Adheres to stringent data privacy standards, ensuring secure keystroke data processing.
- **Scalable and Modular**: Easy to integrate with web applications and corporate tools.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/continuous-behavioral-authentication.git

## Data Collection

There was't any dataset present of keystroke patterns so build standalone desktop application to collect keystrokes from users. The create a typing pattern used calculated 3 different type of timings for each key pressed.

Hold time – time between press and release of a key.
Keydown-Keydown time – time between the pressing of consecutive keys.
Keyup-Keydown time – time between the release of one key and the press of next key.
